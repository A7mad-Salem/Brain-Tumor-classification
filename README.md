# Brain-Tumor-classification
💡 What this project does
Using MRI scans as input, my model can predict whether a brain tumor is present. This can help radiologists and doctors save time and focus on the critical decision-making process.

⚙️ How I built it (step by step)
✅ Data Preparation: Preprocessed MRI images (resizing, normalization, augmentation) to improve model generalization.
✅ Deep Learning Model (PyTorch): Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Fully Connected layers.
✅ Training: Used Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss, along with learning rate scheduling and early stopping.
✅ Evaluation: Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and created a confusion matrix for better insights.
✅ Results: Achieved high performance and demonstrated the potential of AI in medical imaging.
